menuconfig SENSORS
	bool "Sensor devices"
	help
	  Say Y here, and a list of sensors drivers will be displayed.
	  Everything that didn't fit into the other categories is here. This option
	  doesn't affect the kernel.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config SENSORS_CORE
	bool "Sensors Class Support"
	help
	  This option enables the sensor sysfs class in /sys/class/sensors.
	  You'll need this to do anything useful with sensorss. If unsure, say N.

config ST_LSM6DS3
